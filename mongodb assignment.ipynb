    "Ans1. MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that provides high performance, scalability, and flexibility. Non-relational databases, such as MongoDB, are designed to store and retrieve data without a fixed schema like traditional SQL databases. They offer a more flexible data model and are suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Non-relational databases excel in scenarios where data structures can evolve over time, rapid development and iteration are required, or horizontal scalability is crucial.\n",

    "Ans3. To connect MongoDB to Python, you can use the pymongo library. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates connecting to MongoDB, creating a database, and a collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new database\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new collection within the database\n",
    "mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above, we import the `pymongo` library and use the `MongoClient` class to connect to the MongoDB instance running on the local machine. We specify the connection URL (`mongodb://localhost:27017/`) and assign it to the `client` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we create a new database named \"mydatabase\" using the `client[\"mydatabase\"]` syntax and assign it to the `mydb` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we create a new collection named \"customers\" within the \"mydatabase\" database using the `mydb[\"customers\"]` syntax and assign it to the `mycol` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans4. Here's an example code that demonstrates inserting one record and multiple records into the previously created MongoDB collection and then printing the inserted records using the `find()` and `find_one()` methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the database and collection\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "record1 = {\"name\": \"John\", \"address\": \"123 Street\", \"age\": 30}\n",
    "mycol.insert_one(record1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert multiple records\n",
    "records = [\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"address\": \"456 Avenue\", \"age\": 25},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"address\": \"789 Road\", \"age\": 35},\n",
    "]\n",
    "mycol.insert_many(records)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the inserted records\n",
    "print(\"Inserted records:\")\n",
    "for record in mycol.find():\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"\\nFirst inserted record:\")\n",
    "print(mycol.find_one())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above, we access the \"mydatabase\" database and the \"customers\" collection using the `mydb` and `mycol` variables, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We insert one record using the `insert_one()` method, passing a dictionary representing the record's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We insert multiple records using the `insert_many()` method, passing a list of dictionaries representing the records' data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To print the inserted records, we use the `find()` method with no query parameters to retrieve all records from the collection and iterate over them. We also use the `find_one()` method to retrieve the first inserted record.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans5. The `find()` method in MongoDB is used to query the database and retrieve documents that match certain criteria. It accepts a query object as a parameter, allowing you to specify conditions based on document fields. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates the usage of the `find()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the database and collection\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find documents matching a query\n",
    "query = {\"age\": {\"$gt\": 30}}  # Retrieve customers older than 30\n",
    "results = mycol.find(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the matching documents\n",
    "print(\"Matching documents:\")\n",
    "for doc in results:\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above, we define a query object with a condition to retrieve customers older than 30 years using the `$gt` operator (greater than).\n",
    "\n",
    "We pass the query object to the `find()` method, which returns a cursor object. We iterate over the cursor to access the retrieved documents and print them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans6. The `sort()` method in MongoDB is used to sort the retrieved documents based on one or more fields. It allows you to specify the sorting order as ascending (`pymongo.ASCENDING`, or `1`) or descending (`pymongo.DESCENDING`, or `-1`). Here's an example that demonstrates sorting in MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the database and collection\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find and sort documents\n",
    "query = {\"age\": {\"$gt\": 25}}  # Retrieve customers older than 25\n",
    "results = mycol.find(query).sort(\"age\", pymongo.ASCENDING)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the sorted documents\n",
    "print(\"Sorted documents:\")\n",
    "for doc in results:\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above, we retrieve customers older than 25 using the `$gt` operator and pass the query to the `find()` method. Then, we use the `sort()` method to sort the documents based on the \"age\" field in ascending order (`pymongo.ASCENDING`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The sorted documents are printed by iterating over the cursor object returned by `find()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans7. In MongoDB, the `delete_one()`,\n",
    "\n",
    " `delete_many()`, and `drop()` methods are used for different deletion operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `delete_one()`: This method is used to delete a single document that matches the specified criteria. If multiple documents match the criteria, only the first one encountered is deleted. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "  client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Access the database and collection\n",
    "  mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "  mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Delete a single document\n",
    "  query = {\"name\": \"Alice\"}\n",
    "  mycol.delete_one(query)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `delete_many()`: This method is used to delete multiple documents that match the specified criteria. It deletes all documents that match the criteria. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "  client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Access the database and collection\n",
    "  mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "  mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Delete multiple documents\n",
    "  query = {\"age\": {\"$gt\": 30}}  # Delete customers older than 30\n",
    "  mycol.delete_many(query)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `drop()`: This method is used to delete an entire collection from the database. It removes the collection and all its associated documents. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "  client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Access the database and collection\n",
    "  mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "  mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Drop the collection\n",
    "  mycol.drop()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to exercise caution when using deletion methods as they can permanently remove data from the database. Always double-check the query criteria to avoid unintended deletions.\n",
